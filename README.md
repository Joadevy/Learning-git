# About 
This repository has been created to practice git and learn something about it.
> I have done the [Platzi git & github course](http://https://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/ "Platzi git & github course") and it was great. I learned about many interesting and useful features of this incredible tool.

# What I Learned?
On this course I saw different aspects like:
* All GIT commands.
* HTTPS/SSH protocols.
* Tags & versions.
* Professional workflow with git & github.
* Pull request management.
* Ignore files that there are not code and good practices.
